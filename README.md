# 🎰 JackpotMachine777

Hi there! I'm 17 and on my way to becoming a fullstack web developer.  
So far, I'm comfortable with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and SQL.  
This summer I'm learning React and building fullstack projects. 🚀

## 🔧 Tech stack I'm working with:
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (OOP)
- Node.js / Express / SQL
- React (currently learning)

## 🎯 My goal:
**To land a junior fullstack developer job during school year (after classes)**

## 📁 My projects:
- 🎰 [Slot Machine – built with pure JS](https://github.com/JackpotMachine777/jackpot-machine)
- 💻 More coming soon – portfolio in progress!
